 üìê **ARCHITECTURE**
==================

 üß© **Project Overview**
-----------------------

This is a **multi-level comment system API** backend built with Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to create comments, reply to existing comments, and retrieve comments with pagination. The system includes JWT-based authentication, rate-limiting, and supports the hierarchical structure of comments. The application is containerized using Docker and configured via environment variables.

 üóÑ **Database Models**
------------------

### üìö Models Documentation

This document provides an overview of the Mongoose models used in the project.

#### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **User Registration Model**

**Structure**:

- `username`: A unique string identifier for the user.
- `email`: The user's email address (must be unique).
- `password`: The user's password, validated for complexity (e.g., length, uppercase/lowercase, numeric, and special characters).
- `createdAt`: Timestamp for when the user account was created.
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp for when the user data was last updated.

**Purpose**: This model handles the user registration process. It ensures that each user has a unique username and email, and that the password adheres to complexity rules.

---

#### üí¨ **Post Model**

**Structure**:

- `postId`: A unique identifier for the post (auto-incremented by `mongoose-sequence`).
- `userId`: The ID of the user who created the post (required, references the `User` model).
- `title`: The title of the post (required, trimmed, min length 3 characters, max length 50 characters).
- `content`: The main content of the post (required, trimmed, min length 1 character, max length 150 characters).
- `createdAt`: Timestamp for when the post was created.
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp for when the post was last updated.

**Purpose**: This model defines and stores information related to posts. It ensures that each post has a unique `postId`, a `userId` associated with the user who created the post, and a `title` and `content`.

**Auto-Incrementing `postId`**:
- The `postId` is auto-incremented using the `mongoose-sequence` plugin, ensuring each post has a unique identifier.
- This allows efficient querying and management of posts.

**Indexes**:
- `postId`: Ensures uniqueness and efficient querying for the post identifier.
- `userId`: Helps retrieve all posts created by a specific user.
- `createdAt`: Used for efficient sorting and querying of posts by creation date.

#### üí¨ Comment Model

**Structure**:

- `postId`: ID of the post the comment belongs to.
- `userId`: The ID of the user who created the comment.
- `text`: Content of the comment.
- `createdAt`: Timestamp for when the comment was created.
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp for when the comment was last updated.
- `parentCommentId`: ID of the parent comment if this is a reply.

**Purpose**: This model stores comments made by users, whether direct comments or replies to existing comments.

#### üîÑ Indexes

- **Comment Indexes**:
    - `postId` for fast retrieval of comments for a specific post.
    - `parentCommentId` for querying replies quickly.

---

### üîê Security Considerations

- **User Registration**: Passwords should follow specified complexity rules.
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data, especially passwords, should be encrypted.

---

 ‚ö° **Potential Improvements**

- **Comment Model**:
    - Add **media attachments** support to allow comments to contain images, videos, etc.
- **Scalability**: Add **sharding** to MongoDB to handle large volumes of posts and comments efficiently.

---
 üìã **Project Overview**
-----------------------

### ‚úÖ Testing

Jest is used for unit testing layers. Integration tests ensure full api's functionality.
Test files are added in **/src/tests** change the **NODE_ENV=test** and run **npm run test** command to execute tests.

- **Focus Areas**:
    - **Comment Handling**: Test the creation, replying, and pagination of comments.
    - **Rate Limiting**: Ensure rate limits are enforced correctly for both comments and replies.

---

 üì¶ **Deployment**
-----------------

- **Dockerized** with a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Environment variables** managed via `.env`.
- Suitable for deployment on platforms like:
    - Railway
    - Render
    - AWS ECS

---

 üìä **Swagger Documentation**
---------------------------

API documentation is available at `/api-docs` for all endpoints, including the new comment-related ones.

---

 üöÄ **Potential Improvements**
-----------------------------

| Area | Suggestions |
| --- | --- |
| Performance | Implement **caching** for frequently accessed posts and comments. |
| Scalability | Implement **sharding** and **horizontal scaling**. |
| Security | **brute force** protection for login and comment APIs. |
| Features | Add **media message support** in comments. |
| Testing | Add **integration tests** for the complete comment workflow. |

---

 üìå **Design Considerations**
----------------------------

- **Modular Structure**: Clear separation of concerns for maintainability.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures contracts are enforced across layers.
- **Docker-Ready**: Docker containerized for easy deployment.
